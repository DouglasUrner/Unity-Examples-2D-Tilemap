# Unity-Examples-2D-Tilemap

How to build a 2D world using Unity's Tilemap objects. The Tilemap engine was released in October of 217 in Unity 2017.2, tutorials and other reference materials that refer to earlier versions of Unity or that are dated before then are out of date with respect to the "state of the art." In Unity 2018.2 support for hexagonal tiles was added, and in Unity 2018.3 isometric 2D views got native support.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
1. Watch the 2nd and 3rd videos of the **Live Session: 2D World building w/ Tilemap & Cinemachine for 2D**.
1. Launch Unity.
1. Open the Penny Pixel project.
1. Try them out.

Items mentionoed in the tutorial videos, these are all included in the **2D Tilemap** [tutorial assets](), the links below will be helpful if you want to include them in other projects:

* [Unity 2D Extras][2d-extras] - be sure that you are choosing the right branch (version).
* [Cinemachine][]

## Key Points and Major Elements

* Grid
  - Parent of all Tilemaps (similar in concept to the UI Canvas)
  - Resolutions of the tiles and the grid need to match - otherwise you will have gaps (or overlaps).
    - Grid Cell Size: Cell size in Unity units.
    - Sprite Pixels per Unit: the number of pixels to span a unit.
* Tilemap  
  There can be multiple tilemaps (background, foreground, etc.).
  - Sort order (layers) on Tilemap renderer.
* Tile Palatte
* Tilemap Collider
* Working with sprite sheets:
  - Importing
  - Slicing
  - Scaling (pixels per unit)
