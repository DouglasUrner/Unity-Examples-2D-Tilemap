# Unity-Examples-2D-Tilemap

How to build a 2D world using Unity's Tilemap objects. The Tilemap engine was released in October of 217 in Unity 2017.2, tutorials and other reference materials that refer to earlier versions of Unity or that are dated before then are out of date with respect to the "state of the art." In Unity 2018.2 support for hexagonal tiles was added, and in Unity 2018.3 isometric 2D views got native support.
