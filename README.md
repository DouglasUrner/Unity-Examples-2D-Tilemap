# Unity-Examples-2D-Tilemap

How to build a 2D world using Unity's Tilemap objects. The Tilemap engine was released in October of 217 in Unity 2017.2, tutorials and other reference materials that refer to earlier versions of Unity or that are dated before then are out of date with respect to the "state of the art." In Unity 2018.2 support for hexagonal tiles was added, and in Unity 2018.3 isometric 2D views got native support.

## Key Points and Major Elements

* Working with sprite sheets:
  - Importing
  - Slicing
  - Scaling (pixels per unit)
* Grid
  - Resolutions of the tiles and the grid need to match - otherwise you will have gaps (or overlaps).
* Tilemap  
  There can be multiple tilemaps (background, foreground, etc.).
  - Sort order (layers) on Tilemap renderer.
* Tilemap collider
